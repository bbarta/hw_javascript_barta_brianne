# Resources
1. [JavaScript Function Definitions](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_definition.asp)
I used this resource to brush up on functions and how to invoke them when I needed a little more guidance..

2. [Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/)
I wanted to make sure I was not confusing function declarations and function expressions, and this resource elaborated on this for me.

3. [Arrays and Objects in JS](https://welcomedata.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/arrays-and-objects-in-js/)
I was struggling with arrays and objects, especially putting an object inside an array, so seeing more examples here was helpful.

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
Still getting the hang of making commits and when to do them. I had gone through the entire assignment with only the initial commit, but after reading the deducations document, I started over and committed frequently. I get it now!

Somehow I accidentally recommitted my second commit "add arrays branch and start main.js". I don't know how I did this, and I can't figure out what branch this commit is on :( help! Thanks
